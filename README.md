# AIRobo
First AI Robotics Project

I aim to make a pet teasing robot toy. The robot should be able to chase the pet and/or run away from the pet. 

I will have combine object detection models and deep learning to detect the pet. An ultrasound sensor will be fitted to detect proximity of the pet. 

I have used a dataset consisting of dog and cat pictures (sourced from https://github.com/laxmimerit/dog-cat-full-dataset.git), in an attempt to reduce overfitting the model towards one specific animal or type of animal.
